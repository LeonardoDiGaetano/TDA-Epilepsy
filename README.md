# Functions for Data Analysis in "Neighbourhood topology unveils the emergence of pathological hubs in epilepsy surgery"

This GitHub repository contains the Python functions used for the analysis and processing of data discussed in our work titled "Neighbourhood topology unveils the emergence of pathological hubs in epilepsy surgery." Please note that this repository does not include the dataset itself but only the Python scripts necessary for preprocessing the data and calculating the metrics presented in our study.

## Reference
The preprint of our work can be accessed on arXiv: [insert arXiv link here]

## About the Code
The `.py` file in this repository contains all the necessary functions for:
- Data preprocessing
- Computation of various metrics used in our analysis

### Dependencies
The functions related to the computation of Betti numbers are developed using the GUDHI library, a tool suite for Topological Data Analysis (TDA). For more information about GUDHI, visit [GUDHI official website](https://gudhi.inria.fr/index.html).
